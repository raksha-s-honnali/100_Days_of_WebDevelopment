    <h1>Making Bread</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)</li>
    <li>1 packet active dry yeast (about 2 ¼ tsp)</li>
    <li> 1 ½ tsp salt</li>
    <li> 1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups warm water (about 110°F)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil (or melted butter)</li>
</ul>

        <li><span>Activate the yeast:</span><br />In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes frothy. If it doesnot foam up, your yeast may be expired, and you'll want to try a fresh packet.</li>
        <li><span>Mix the dough:</span><br /> In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Once the yeast mixture is ready, pour it into the bowl with the flour mixture. Add the olive oil (or melted butter) and stir everything together until it forms a dough.</li>
        <li><span>Knead the dough:</span><br /> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for about 8-10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can add a bit of flour if it's too sticky, but try not to add too much, as it will affect the texture.</li>
        <li><span>Let it rise:</span><br /> Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li><span>Shape the dough:</span><br /> Punch down the dough to release the air. Then, shape it into a loaf by folding the edges into the center and rolling it up tightly. Place it into a greased loaf pan.</li>
        <li><span>Second rise:</span> <br />Cover the loaf with the towel again and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes, until it has puffed up.</li>
        <li><span>Preheat the oven:</span><br /> While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><span>Bake the bread:</span><br /> Once the dough has risen, place the loaf in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
        <li><span>Cool:</span><br /> Let the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing.
