# 100_Days_of_WebDevelopment
I am on a journey to chase my dreams. Instead of going aimlessly I have set a target of 100 days for myself where I would learn and track my learning for the next 100 days. It's a way of coming out of my comfort zone and grow as a person I want to be. 

Every day is Unique
Every day is Challenging
Each and everything that I do contributes to my growth
